## Idea Board

- This program is initially built for me and my family members who live in different countries with different time zones. 
- When this program is ready, we can communicate with each other without having to calculate their current, past, or future times in different time zones when trying to reach out to each other. 
- This program will also have an auto-send system that will have a message sent at a specific time of the receiver. For example, if I want a person residing in Korea to receive this message at 8AM their time, I can set their time for the receiving time then it'll automatically send the message at 3PM PST, without me having to calculate the time difference. 
- End goal for this program is to successfully apply software knowledge learned in Epicodus and to learn how to use Swift, the iOS app development tool. 
- Possible roadblocks: I have not developed an app that involves real-time messaging system or account set-up for users. 
- If I were asked to begin working on this program now, I would start with coming up with dashboard design on Figma and see what can be done with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and webpack.
